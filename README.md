Project Title: SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Project Description:

The "SMS Spam Detection" project is a machine learning-based solution designed to automatically classify short message service (SMS) messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). With the proliferation of mobile devices and text messaging, SMS spam has become a significant nuisance. This project aims to provide users with a tool to filter out unwanted messages, enhancing their overall mobile experience.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The project begins with the collection of a dataset containing SMS messages, which are labeled as spam or ham. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for analysis. This includes text tokenization, removing stopwords, and vectorizing the text data.

Machine Learning Models: The heart of the project involves training and evaluating machine learning models to classify SMS messages. Commonly used algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest are implemented and fine-tuned for optimal performance.

Evaluation Metrics: The performance of the models is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics help determine the model's ability to correctly classify spam and ham messages.

Model Deployment: Upon achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy and performance, the chosen model is deployed into a user-friendly interface. Users can input SMS messages, and the system will instantly classify them as spam or ham.

User Interface (UI): To make the solution accessible to non-technical users, a simple and intuitive UI is designed. Users can interact with the application through a web-based interface or a mobile app, providing them with an efficient spam-filtering tool.

Continuous Improvement: The project includes a mechanism for feedback and continuous improvement. Users can report misclassified messages, allowing the model to adapt and enhance its accuracy over time.
